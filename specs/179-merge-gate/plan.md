# Implementation Plan: Merge Gate

**Branch**: `179-merge-automation` | **Date**: 2026-04-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Single-story feature specification from `/specs/179-merge-automation/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement MM-341 by adding a distinct merge-automation lifecycle after successful pull request publication. `MoonMind.Run` continues to own implementation, publishing, proposals, and finalization; after a PR is confirmed and merge automation is enabled, it starts one `MoonMind.MergeAutomation` workflow carrying compact PR, policy, Jira, and parent-run refs. The merge gate evaluates external readiness through activities, records operator-visible blockers, and creates one resolver follow-up `MoonMind.Run` using pr-resolver with publish mode `none` only when configured conditions are satisfied. Validation focuses on unit tests for contracts and deterministic helpers plus Temporal workflow-boundary tests for parent-to-gate startup, blocker persistence, duplicate resolver prevention, and resolver-side readiness reuse.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 
**Primary Dependencies**: Temporal Python SDK, Pydantic v2, existing MoonMind workflow/activity catalog, existing GitHub/Jira trusted integration surfaces, pr-resolver skill 
**Storage**: Existing Temporal workflow history, Search Attributes, Memo, and existing execution/projection records; no new persistent database tables planned 
**Unit Testing**: `pytest` via `./tools/test_unit.sh` with focused targets during iteration 
**Integration Testing**: `pytest` Temporal workflow-boundary tests; hermetic integration validation via `./tools/test_integration.sh` when compose services are available 
**Target Platform**: Linux worker containers and local Docker Compose Temporal deployment 
**Project Type**: Temporal-backed orchestration service with API/UI observability surfaces 
**Performance Goals**: Parent implementation run finalizes without waiting on long-lived review latency; merge-automation readiness polling is bounded and does not create duplicate resolver runs under retry or replay 
**Constraints**: Workflow code must remain deterministic; external GitHub/Jira/API reads and resolver execution creation must occur through activities or existing service boundaries; workflow payloads must stay compact and avoid large logs, comments, or provider bodies; pr-resolver follow-up must use publish mode `none` 
**Scale/Scope**: One merge gate per merge-automation-enabled PR publication, tracking one current PR revision and at most one resolver follow-up for that revision

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Orchestrate, Don't Recreate**: PASS. The plan composes existing `MoonMind.Run`, Temporal workflow orchestration, GitHub/Jira activities, and pr-resolver instead of rebuilding resolver behavior.
- **II. One-Click Agent Deployment**: PASS. The feature uses existing Docker Compose/Temporal worker infrastructure and does not add required external services beyond already-configured GitHub/Jira integrations.
- **III. Avoid Vendor Lock-In**: PASS. GitHub and Jira readiness are modeled as activity-backed evidence behind merge-automation contracts; provider-specific calls remain outside workflow logic.
- **IV. Own Your Data**: PASS. Gate state, blockers, and resolver refs remain in Temporal state/artifacts/projections under operator-controlled infrastructure, with compact refs rather than external-only storage.
- **V. Skills Are First-Class and Easy to Add**: PASS. The resolver follow-up uses the existing pr-resolver skill contract with publish mode `none`.
- **VI. Design for Deletion / Scientific Method**: PASS. Merge-gate readiness is a narrow contract around observable evidence and tests, so future resolver capabilities can replace parts without changing parent implementation semantics.
- **VII. Powerful Runtime Configurability**: PASS. Merge automation is represented as explicit task/policy input with safe default disabled behavior.
- **VIII. Modular and Extensible Architecture**: PASS. A separate workflow type and activity/service boundaries isolate long-lived gate behavior from parent run execution.
- **IX. Resilient by Default**: PASS. Duplicate resolver prevention, retry-safe launch state, deterministic blockers, and workflow-boundary regression tests are first-class requirements.
- **X. Facilitate Continuous Improvement**: PASS. Gate and resolver outcomes are operator-visible lifecycle states with clear blocked/completed reasons.
- **XI. Spec-Driven Development Is the Source of Truth**: PASS. This plan follows `specs/179-merge-automation/spec.md` and preserves MM-341 traceability.
- **XII. Canonical Documentation Separates Desired State from Migration Backlog**: PASS. Any implementation tracking stays in MoonSpec artifacts or `local-only handoffs` if needed, not in canonical docs.
- **XIII. Pre-Release Compatibility Policy**: PASS. The plan adds explicit new contracts instead of compatibility aliases. Temporal payload changes will be versioned or covered at workflow boundaries where in-flight safety matters.

**Structure Decision**: Implement a new Temporal workflow module for long-lived gate state, keep external PR/Jira checks and resolver creation in activities, register the workflow in the existing worker topology, and add focused workflow-boundary tests near existing `MoonMind.Run` and Temporal workflow tests. Data model and contract artifacts are required because the story introduces new workflow payloads, states, and integration boundaries.
