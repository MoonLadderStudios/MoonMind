# Specification Quality Checklist: Codex Managed Session Phase 4/5 Hardening

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond user-provided platform vocabulary and constraints
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic except where preserving explicit user-provided constraints
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No avoidable implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Runtime scope guard is present as FR-002: "Required deliverables include production runtime code changes (not docs/spec-only) plus validation tests."
- The spec preserves user-provided Temporal, Search Attribute, scheduled reconcile, Continue-As-New, and replay constraints because they define the requested system contract.
