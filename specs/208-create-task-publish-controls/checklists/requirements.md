# Specification Quality Checklist: Create Task Publish Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Exactly one user story is defined
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Runtime intent describes system behavior rather than docs-only changes, unless docs-only was explicitly requested
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Independent Test describes how the story can be validated end-to-end
- [x] Acceptance scenarios are concrete enough to derive unit and integration tests
- [x] No in-scope source design requirements are unmapped from functional requirements
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] The single user story covers the primary flow
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Input classified as a single-story runtime feature request.
- Existing artifacts were inspected; no existing MM-412 spec directory was found, so orchestration resumed at the specify stage.
- Source design requirements from `docs/UI/CreatePage.md` sections 5, 7.6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 are mapped to functional requirements.
