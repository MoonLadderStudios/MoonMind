# Specification Quality Checklist: Tailwind Style System Phase 3 Dark Mode

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-19  
**Feature**: `specs/026-tailwind-dark-mode/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Document-backed completeness gate passed: `DOC-REQ-001` through `DOC-REQ-010` are each mapped to Functional Requirements.
- Phase 3 scope is explicitly bounded; mobile and later visual-polish phases remain out of scope for this feature.
