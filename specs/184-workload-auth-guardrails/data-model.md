# Data Model: Workload Auth-Volume Guardrails

## WorkloadLaunchRequest

- Purpose: profile, workspace/cache mounts, requested credential mounts, caller context.
- Validation: values must be explicit, non-secret, and safe to serialize across the story boundary.
- Relationships: participates only in this story's declared source-design coverage and dependency chain.
- State transitions: invalid or unsupported values fail fast before externally visible side effects.

## CredentialMountPolicy

- Purpose: allowlist, justification, approval metadata.
- Validation: values must be explicit, non-secret, and safe to serialize across the story boundary.
- Relationships: participates only in this story's declared source-design coverage and dependency chain.
- State transitions: invalid or unsupported values fail fast before externally visible side effects.

## WorkloadResult

- Purpose: stdout/stderr/result metadata redacted and separated from managed-session identity.
- Validation: values must be explicit, non-secret, and safe to serialize across the story boundary.
- Relationships: participates only in this story's declared source-design coverage and dependency chain.
- State transitions: invalid or unsupported values fail fast before externally visible side effects.

## Cross-Cutting Rules

- Preserve Jira issue key `MM-360` as traceability metadata in generated artifacts.
- Never model raw credential contents, token values, private keys, environment dumps, or raw auth-volume listings as persisted or browser-visible fields.
- Prefer compact refs and explicit status values over provider-shaped dictionaries.
