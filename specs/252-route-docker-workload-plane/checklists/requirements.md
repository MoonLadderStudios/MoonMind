# Specification Quality Checklist: Shared Docker Workload Execution Plane

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Exactly one user story is defined
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Runtime intent describes system behavior rather than docs-only changes, unless docs-only was explicitly requested
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Independent Test describes how the story can be validated end-to-end
- [x] Acceptance scenarios are concrete enough to derive unit and integration tests
- [x] No in-scope source design requirements are unmapped from functional requirements
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] The single user story covers the primary flow
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Checklist passed after initial spec drafting. The spec preserves the original MM-503 orchestration brief, keeps runtime intent explicit, grounds source mappings in `docs/ManagedAgents/DockerOutOfDocker.md`, and maps all in-scope `DESIGN-REQ-*` requirements to functional requirements.
