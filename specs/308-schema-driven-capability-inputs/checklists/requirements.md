# Specification Quality Checklist: Schema-Driven Capability Inputs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Exactly one user story is defined
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Runtime intent describes system behavior rather than docs-only changes, unless docs-only was explicitly requested
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Independent Test describes how the story can be validated end-to-end
- [X] Acceptance scenarios are concrete enough to derive unit and integration tests
- [X] No in-scope source design requirements are unmapped from functional requirements
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] The single user story covers the primary flow
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- PASS: The spec contains exactly one independently testable runtime story selected from the broader MM-593 Jira preset brief.
- PASS: Broader MM-593 items such as submit-time expansion, recursive expansion, and provenance are explicitly out of scope or mapped to existing/later stories.
- PASS: Jira issue MM-593 and the original preset brief are preserved verbatim in the spec input field for downstream verification.
