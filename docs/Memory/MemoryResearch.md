# Memory Strategies for LLM Agents and Recommendations for MoonMind

**Implementation tracking:** Rollout and backlog notes live in MoonSpec artifacts (`specs/<feature>/`), gitignored handoffs (for example `artifacts/`), or other local-only files—not as migration checklists in canonical `docs/`.

Prioritized experiments, schema/API follow-ups, and effort estimates are listed in the tracker; this document stays **research and recommendations**, not a delivery backlog in prose.

## Executive summary

As of February 2026, “memory” for LLM-based agents is best understood as a *systems* problem rather than a single model feature: most reliable deployments combine short-term working memory (what fits in the prompt), durable stores (documents, vectors, databases), and explicit state machines + logs so that agent behavior is auditable and recoverable. Core research results still point to a practical theme: **LLMs are strong reasoners when the right context is surfaced, but weak at reliably “remembering” without deliberate retrieval and state management**—hence the mainstream adoption of retrieval-augmented generation and tiered memory architectures. citeturn22view0turn20view0

From inspecting the MoonMind codebase and deployment manifests (via direct repository file inspection), MoonMind already has several foundational building blocks that align well with best-practice memory stacks:
- A “knowledge base” style semantic memory path built around a vector store (via entity["company","Qdrant","vector database"]) and entity["organization","LlamaIndex","llm data framework"]-based ingestion/retrieval.
- Durable operational state and audit artifacts via a relational DB plus stored workflow artifacts (patches/logs) for Celery-driven orchestrations.
- A growing agent/tool integration story via Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is increasingly positioned as a standard way for agent runtimes to access tools and data sources. citeturn24search0turn24search1

Given MoonMind’s apparent goals (agentic workflows for software production tasks and multi-service automation) and the stated business setting (building a video game), the best “memory” investments are the ones that improve: **cross-session continuity, multi-agent coordination, retrieval quality over heterogeneous project corpora (code + design docs + tickets + asset metadata), and governance (auditability + safety)**.

A prioritized shortlist of memory strategies worth integrating into MoonMind is:
- **Hybrid retrieval + reranking (semantic + lexical) as a first-class memory layer** (build on Qdrant’s dense/sparse + reranking patterns, add metadata, policy filters, and provenance). citeturn21search2turn21search1turn22view0
- **Episodic memory as an event-sourced “agent activity ledger,” then consolidate into semantic memory** (MemGPT/generative-agents style tiering and reflection summarization, but adapted to business workflows). citeturn20view0turn18search1
- **Hierarchical summary memory (“living project state”)**: scoped rollups (per feature, system, sprint) with refresh policies and citations back to artifacts. citeturn24search4turn26search1
- **Explicit state + checkpointing (“agent threads”)**: durable thread IDs, run state snapshots, and replay logs (LangGraph/LangChain style), integrated with MCP tool calls. citeturn26search1turn25search6turn24search0

Long-context models (including 200k–1M token contexts in commercial APIs) are valuable enablers, but they are not a complete memory solution; they mainly reduce *friction* when building summaries or doing one-shot large-context tasks, and they raise new cost/latency issues at very large prompt sizes. citeturn23search3turn23search2turn23search0

## MoonMind repository findings and inferred memory requirements

### Observed architecture and data flows

Based on direct inspection of repository source files and configuration (Docker Compose, API routers, workflows, and DB models), MoonMind appears to be:
- A self-hosted “AI orchestration hub” exposing OpenAI-compatible endpoints and routing requests to multiple model providers (including entity["company","Anthropic","ai model vendor"], entity["company","Google","tech company"] and entity["company","OpenAI","ai company"]) while supporting local runtimes.
- A hybrid of:
 - **Interactive chat** (OpenAI-style `/v1/chat/completions`) with optional retrieval injection from a vector index.
 - **Document ingestion** into the vector store from sources such as entity["company","GitHub","code hosting platform"], Confluence, and Google Drive (via LlamaIndex readers).
 - **Workflow automation** using durable Temporal-backed runs (with step artifacts and persisted identity/configuration snapshots where applicable).

Even without assuming any specific production scale (repo does not specify user counts, request rates, latency SLOs, or corpus size), the architecture implies MoonMind will benefit from memory that is:
- **Durable across sessions and runs** (project memory that survives restarts and supports “what did we decide last sprint?” queries).
- **Scoped and access-controlled** (game studios have highly sensitive IP; “memory” must support per-team/per-project boundaries).
- **Queryable in multiple modalities** (code, design docs, meeting notes, tickets, build logs).
- **Auditable** (for tool-using agents that create PRs, execute commands, or generate assets, you need traceability).

### Repository components mapped to memory needs

The table below maps major MoonMind components (as reflected in code and configuration) to the memory requirements they imply. Where quantitative constraints are needed (latency targets, workload mix), they are **unspecified** in the repo and should be treated as parameters to define during implementation.

| Repo component (logical) | Primary function | Current “memory” behavior (observed) | Memory requirements for game-dev agents | High-value memory strategy fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chat API router and model routing | User↔LLM chat, tool routing, RAG injection | Uses a vector retriever to fetch relevant nodes and inject context; model routing is provider-aware | Thread continuity across multi-day features; user preference memory; safe tool-use traces | Working + summary memory; long-term user/app memory store; episodic ledger |
| Document ingestion (GitHub/Confluence/Drive indexers) | Build/update knowledge base | Ingests documents into embeddings and vector index | Mixed corpora retrieval for code, docs, design specs, tickets; provenance + freshness control | Hybrid retrieval and reranking; hierarchical indexes; doc metadata and ACLs |
| Workflow automation (spec workflow, PR generation, system runs) | Agentic execution + artifacts | Persists run/task state and writes logs/patches as artifacts | Episodic memory of “what happened” (attempts, failures, fixes), reusable across runs | Event-sourced episodic store + embedding; run summarization into semantic memory |
| DB models for users and profiles | User identity and secrets | Encrypted API keys; structured run records | Personalization without leaking secrets; policy enforcement by user/team | “Memory namespaces” with RBAC; secret redaction; audit trails |
| MCP integration docs/config | Connect agents to tools/data | MCP is positioned as standardized tool/data connector | Safe tool execution, controlled “write” operations, reproducible runs | Tool/state management; governance layer around memory writes |

MCP is explicitly described as a standardized way to connect LLM apps to tools and data sources, and the spec emphasizes normative requirements and interoperability. citeturn24search0turn24search1

## Taxonomy of memory strategies for LLMs

This taxonomy reflects widely used strategies in production systems and notable research directions through February 2026, including the specific categories requested. The emphasis here is on **mechanism, implementation patterns, tradeoffs, and maturity/adoption**.

### Episodic memory

**Mechanism:** Store time-ordered “experience” events (conversation turns, tool calls, decisions, task outcomes), then retrieve by recency, similarity, or causal linkage (“the last time we tried this build step”).
**Typical implementations:** Append-only event logs; relational tables keyed by `thread_id/run_id`; search via metadata + embeddings; optional “importance” scoring and reflection (generative agents). citeturn18search1turn20view0
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Excellent for auditability and debugging; supports learning from past attempts; natural fit for agent workflows (CI failures, PR diffs).
- Cons: Can grow without bound; retrieval requires strong filtering/aggregation to avoid noise; privacy risks if raw logs include secrets.
**Scalability/latency/cost:** Scales well if the primary store is metadata-filterable (SQL) and embeddings are stored on selected fields; retrieval can be low-latency when scoped.
**Security:** Highest risk category because raw events often include credentials, proprietary code, or internal links; needs aggressive redaction + access controls.
**Maturity:** High in agentic systems; “memory as logs” is a core enterprise pattern even outside LLMs.

### Semantic memory

**Mechanism:** Store distilled, relatively stable knowledge (facts, conventions, decisions, “canon lore”), usually as documents/nodes with embeddings and metadata; retrieve semantically.
**Typical implementations:** RAG over curated corpora; knowledge graphs plus embeddings; “decision registry” docs; “project constitution” artifacts. RAG explicitly combines parametric memory (weights) with non-parametric memory (retrieved documents). citeturn22view0
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: High signal-to-noise; supports organization-wide alignment; easy to reuse across agents.
- Cons: Requires governance to prevent drift and contradictions; can become stale without refresh policies.
**Scalability/latency/cost:** Very scalable with vector DB + filtering; cost dominated by embedding and reranking.
**Security:** Can be safer than episodic logs if content is curated and scrubbed.

### Working memory and context window augmentation

**Mechanism:** Optimize what goes into the current prompt: sliding windows, context packing, “relevant snippet” selection, and prompt caching.
**Typical implementations:** Token-budgeted prompt assembly; message trimming; local caches; recency weighting; selective retrieval feeding.
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Directly improves response quality; low architectural risk.
- Cons: Still bounded; often brittle under long-horizon tasks unless paired with durable stores.
**Maturity:** Universal; all serious agent stacks do some form of this.

### Retrieval-augmented generation

**Mechanism:** Retrieve external passages and condition generation on them; improves factuality and provenance and supports updating knowledge without retraining weights. citeturn22view0
**Typical implementations:** Dense retrieval (embeddings); hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse/BM25); reranking; chunking; citations/provenance tracking.
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Strong ROI; reduces hallucination for domain content; enables “bring your own knowledge.”
- Cons: Vulnerable to prompt injection in retrieved text; retrieval failures can cause confident wrong answers.
**Maturity:** Extremely high; widely adopted across enterprise systems. citeturn22view0

### Vector databases and embedding stores

**Mechanism:** Store embeddings (and often metadata/payload) for fast similarity search.
**Typical implementations:** Dedicated vector DBs (Qdrant / Weaviate / Milvus), general-purpose stores with vector extensions (Redis), or libraries (FAISS). citeturn21search2turn21search1turn29search0turn21search0
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Enables scalable semantic retrieval; supports metadata filtering and (in some systems) hybrid search.
- Cons: Operational complexity (indexing, backups, schema evolution); embedding model changes require re-embedding.
**Maturity:** High; but product differences matter (hybrid search capabilities, multi-tenancy, on-prem constraints).

### Hierarchical memory

**Mechanism:** Tier memories by speed/cost/importance (like caches): short-term buffer → summarized state → vector store → archival. MemGPT explicitly frames this as “virtual context management” inspired by OS memory tiers. citeturn20view0
**Typical implementations:** “Hot” memory = recent messages; “warm” = rolling summaries; “cold” = full corpus; policies decide movement and eviction.
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Strong for long-running copilots and multi-session projects; cost-effective at scale.
- Cons: Needs careful policy design and evaluation; summarization drift can accumulate.

### Long-context models

**Mechanism:** Increase the prompt capacity so more raw context can be placed directly in-window.
**State as of Feb 2026:** 200k token contexts were mainstream earlier; 1M token contexts have become available in some commercial APIs, often with tiering and premium pricing for very long requests. citeturn23search3turn23search0turn23search2
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Reduces the need for chunking in some workflows; powerful for one-shot analysis (large specs, whole subsystems).
- Cons: Latency and cost can scale sharply at extreme context sizes; still benefits from retrieval to focus attention; governance remains needed (what you put into the prompt is still data egress).
**Maturity:** High availability, but operational cost management and evaluation remain active concerns.

### External tool and state management

**Mechanism:** Use tools for reading/writing state (task trackers, repos, build systems) and persist agent state in explicit stores—agents become orchestrations over tools. ReAct and Toolformer show canonical patterns: interleaving reasoning with actions (ReAct) and training/finetuning models to decide tool calls (Toolformer). citeturn28view0turn28view1
**Typical implementations:** State machines/graphs; checkpointers; tool-call logs; MCP servers for standard tool connectivity. citeturn24search0turn26search1
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Strong auditability; deterministic recovery/replay; separation of concerns between model and system state.
- Cons: Integration complexity and security surface area (tool auth, injection, permissioning).

### Learned memory modules and memory-augmented transformers

**Mechanism:** Modify model architecture to carry forward memory across segments (recurrence) or compress past context into a memory bank. RMT (recurrent memory augmentation) is one approach to scaling to very long sequences with linear-ish compute, while Compressive Transformer and Transformer-XL are earlier canonical architectures for recurrence/compression. citeturn18search6turn19search1turn19search5
**Typical implementations:** Specialized model architectures or inference schemes; not typically “bolt-on” to closed commercial APIs.
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Potentially reduces dependence on external retrieval in some settings; can handle long-range dependencies.
- Cons: Harder to operationalize; may require training access; weaker ecosystem maturity than RAG for business agents.
**Maturity:** Mostly research-to-early-productization as of Feb 2026.

### Memory via fine-tuning and continual learning

**Mechanism:** Encode “memory” into weights via finetuning, adapters (LoRA), or continual training.
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Fast inference (knowledge internalized); can enforce style/format conventions.
- Cons: Expensive; risk of catastrophic forgetting; hard provenance; safety/compliance hurdles; retraining cadence.
**Maturity:** Common for style/domain adaptation but risky as the *primary* memory mechanism for fast-changing project state.

### Compressed summaries

**Mechanism:** Periodically summarize long interaction histories or corpora into compact state, then include that summary in prompts or store it long-term. LlamaIndex explicitly supports summary-based memory buffers and more flexible memory abstractions. citeturn24search4
**Pros/cons:**
- Pros: Cost-effective; reduces prompt bloat; supports long-running threads.
- Cons: Summary drift; loss of detail; requires evaluation and refresh policies.

### Latent memory

**Mechanism:** Store memory in hidden states or learned vectors (e.g., recurrent segment memories in Transformer-XL or memory tokens in RMT). citeturn19search5turn18search6
**Pros/cons:** Similar to learned memory modules; powerful but harder to integrate without model control.

### Hybrid approaches

**Mechanism:** Combine multiple memory layers (buffer + summaries + event log + RAG + tools). MemGPT and generative agents both articulate explicit multi-tier patterns (store everything, summarize/reflect, retrieve dynamically). citeturn20view0turn18search1
**Maturity:** Highest in real systems—hybrids are the norm.

## Suitability for agentic game development workflows

Game development (as a business setting) has a distinctive memory profile:
- Highly heterogeneous knowledge: narrative/lore, gameplay rules, level design docs, art direction, shader code, engine/editor scripts, build pipelines, and bug triage.
- Strong IP sensitivity (assets and source).
- Many parallel “threads” (features, milestones, multiple disciplines).
- High value in *organizational memory*: why decisions were made, what was tried, and what failed.

The table below summarizes how each memory strategy typically performs against the requested criteria (H/M/L), assuming a studio environment building an actual game. These are not absolute truths; they are default expectations based on observed patterns in research and widely used frameworks.

| Strategy | Persistence | Real-time constraints | Multi-agent coordination | Personalization | Safety/guardrails | Auditability | Integration complexity |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Episodic (event log) | H | M | H | M | M→H (with redaction) | H | M |
| Semantic (curated KB) | H | H | H | M | H | M→H (with provenance) | M |
| Working/context packing | M | H | M | M | M | L | L |
| RAG (dense-only) | H | H | H | M | M (needs injection defense) | M | M |
| Hybrid retrieval + rerank | H | M→H | H | M | M→H | H | M→H |
| Hierarchical memory (tiered) | H | M | H | H | M→H | M | M→H |
| Long-context models | M | L→M (at 1M tokens) | M | L | M | L | L |
| Tool/state management (graphs, checkpointers, MCP) | H | M | H | M | H | H | H |
| Learned/latent memory models | M | M | L | L | M | L | H |
| Finetuning/continual learning as memory | H | H | M | M | M | L | H |
| Compressed summaries | M→H | H | M | M | M | M | M |

Key takeaways for a studio building a game:
- **RAG + hybrid retrieval + metadata** is the fastest path to “project memory” because it directly targets the main pain: retrieving relevant code/doc/decision context. citeturn22view0turn21search1turn21search2
- **Episodic memory is essential for agentic automation** (build orchestration, PR creation, content pipeline tasks) because failures and retries are common; without episodic recall, agents repeat mistakes and teams lose explainability.
- **Explicit state/checkpointing becomes mandatory** once you have multi-step tool-using agents (PR workflows, build steps). ReAct’s core idea—interleaving reasoning and acting—highlights why tools and state must be first-class (the agent is not just “chatting”; it is executing). citeturn28view0
- Long-context helps a lot for “read a whole subsystem/spec at once,” but at large sizes it tends to be expensive and slow, and it does not replace governance or retrieval. citeturn23search0turn23search3

## Recommended memory strategies for MoonMind

This shortlist is prioritized for MoonMind’s apparent architecture (FastAPI + Celery workflows + Qdrant + Postgres) and the needs of a game studio. Engineering effort is expressed as rough ranges for a small team already familiar with the codebase; actual effort depends on *unspecified* repo parameters (scale, latency SLOs, team size, on-prem vs cloud constraints).

### Priority recommendations

#### Hybrid retrieval and reranking as the core semantic memory layer

**What it is:** Upgrade “vector RAG” into a richer retrieval layer: dense + sparse (BM25-like) retrieval, structured filtering, and reranking before context injection. Weaviate documents hybrid search as fusion of vector + keyword (BM25F). Qdrant’s own tutorials describe hybrid retrieval using dense + sparse vectors and then reranking with late-interaction embeddings (e.g., ColBERT-style). citeturn21search1turn21search2

**Why it fits MoonMind:** MoonMind already depends on Qdrant and LlamaIndex, so this is an incremental improvement with high payoff: code search and design docs often require lexical matching (“class name”, “asset ID”, “config key”) that dense embeddings alone can miss.

**Implementation notes (MoonMind-aligned):**
- Extend ingestion pipeline to store:
 - dense embeddings for semantic meaning,
 - sparse representations for lexical strength,
 - rich metadata: `source_type` (code/doc/ticket/log), `repo_path`, `branch`, `commit`, `doc_updated_at`, `security_scope`, `project`, `feature`, `owner`.
- Add a retrieval service abstraction (`MemoryRetrievalService`) that:
 - runs hybrid retrieval,
 - reranks top-N,
 - returns context with provenance (document IDs + offsets).
- Integrate “contextual compression” (summarize or extract only relevant spans) as a post-retrieval step to minimize prompt costs.

**Required components:**
- Qdrant collection(s) with dense + sparse vector support and payload indexes. citeturn21search2turn30search2
- Optional reranker model choice (cross-encoder or late interaction).
- Indexing job(s) (already partially present via document loaders).

**Effort:** ~2–6 engineer-weeks for a production-ready first version (schema, ingestion updates, retrieval API, tests, observability).
**Risks:**
- Prompt injection via retrieved text (must treat retrieved content as untrusted input).
- Embedding model changes requiring re-embedding.
- Evaluation complexity (needs ground truth retrieval tests).

#### Episodic memory ledger with consolidation into semantic memory

**What it is:** Treat every significant agent action as an event (tool call, produced patch, build result, approval gate, user feedback). Store raw events durably; periodically consolidate them into higher-level “reflections” and “lesson summaries,” similar in spirit to generative agents’ reflection and MemGPT’s tiered memory. citeturn18search1turn20view0

**Why it fits MoonMind:** MoonMind already persists workflow runs, step states, and artifacts. Turning that into *queryable memory* unlocks “don’t repeat the last failure” behavior and improves multi-agent coordination (“what did the build agent change last time?”).

**Implementation notes:**
- Define a unified `MemoryEvent` schema (append-only):
 - identifiers: `thread_id`, `run_id`, `task_id`, `actor` (agent/user/service), `timestamp`,
 - event type: `TOOL_CALL`, `TOOL_RESULT`, `DECISION`, `PATCH_APPLIED`, `BUILD_LOG`, `TEST_FAILURE`, `ASSET_GENERATED`,
 - references to artifacts (paths/digests) rather than raw content by default.
- Embed *summaries* of events (not raw logs) into the vector store for semantic retrieval; keep raw artifacts in artifact storage.
- Run consolidation jobs:
 - per-feature rollups (daily/weekly),
 - “failure playbooks” (e.g., common build errors and fix patterns),
 - “decision register” entries.

**Required components:**
- Relational store tables (likely Postgres) as source of truth for events.
- Vector store entries pointing at events/summaries for semantic recall.
- Optional scheduled workers for consolidation.

**Effort:** ~4–10 engineer-weeks (schema + migration + ingestion from existing run records + summarizers + retrieval UX).
**Risks:**
- Privacy/secret leakage from logs; mitigation: redact at event creation, store secrets only in vault/secret manager, and store hashes/refs in events.
- Summary drift; mitigation: keep pointers to source artifacts and refresh summaries.

#### Hierarchical summary memory for “living project state”

**What it is:** Maintain “living” summaries at multiple scopes (project → game system → subsystem → feature → task) that are continuously refreshed from episodic events and source-of-truth docs. This mirrors mainstream framework support: LlamaIndex explicitly discusses combining short-term buffers with long-term memory and summary-based memory. citeturn24search4

**Why it matters for game studios:** A game’s design evolves constantly; “memory” fails if it can’t explain the *current* canon rules while preserving the *history* of why rules changed.

**Implementation notes:**
- Define canonical summary documents:
 - “Game pillars and constraints”
 - “Current combat system rules”
 - “Asset pipeline conventions”
 - “Narrative canon + glossary”
- Each summary includes provenance pointers:
 - source document IDs, PR numbers, ticket references, artifact digests.
- Refresh policy:
 - trigger on new merged PRs, updated design docs, or sprint closeout.

**Effort:** ~2–8 engineer-weeks (depends on how automated you want refreshing to be).
**Risks:**
- Governance overhead (who approves updates to canonical memory).
- Over-summarization losing edge cases (keep provenance and “drill-down” retrieval).

#### Explicit agent state, thread checkpoints, and memory namespaces

**What it is:** “Thread-level persistence” for long-running agent conversations and multi-step plans, plus long-term memory namespaces for user/team-specific facts. LangChain’s memory overview for LangGraph distinguishes short-term thread-scoped memory (persisted via a checkpointer) and long-term memory organized via namespaces and keys, supporting hierarchical organization and filtering. citeturn26search1turn25search6

**Why it fits MoonMind:** MoonMind already uses DB-backed run/task states; formalizing this into a generalized “agent thread” concept allows consistent memory retrieval, better multi-agent coordination, and easier replay/audit.

**Implementation notes:**
- Introduce `thread_id` as a first-class field across chat + workflows.
- Add a “Memory Store API”:
 - `PUT /memory/{namespace}/{key}` for structured memory objects,
 - `SEARCH /memory/{namespace}` with optional semantic query and filter.
- Adopt MCP for tool calls and record tool-call results as part of the thread checkpoint and episodic ledger. citeturn24search0turn24search1

**Effort:** ~4–12 engineer-weeks (API changes, migrations, UI updates, and integration across services).
**Risks:**
- Integration complexity across services and ensuring consistent ID propagation.
- Multi-tenant security correctness (namespaces/ACLs).

## Tooling comparison for implementation choices

MoonMind already uses Qdrant + LlamaIndex. The table below compares major tools mentioned in the request, focusing on features that matter for agent memory in a game studio: hybrid retrieval, on-prem viability, metadata filtering, operational maturity, and licensing.

| Tool | Category | Key capabilities for memory | Licensing / deployment | Suitability notes for a studio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qdrant | Vector DB | Dense + sparse vectors and hybrid retrieval patterns; supports reranking flows in docs | Apache-2.0 citeturn30search2turn21search2 | Strong fit given existing adoption; good path to hybrid retrieval without changing core stack |
| Weaviate | Vector DB | Hybrid search combining vector + BM25F; configurable fusion | BSD-3-Clause citeturn21search1turn30search0 | Good if you want native hybrid and a different ecosystem; migration cost if already on Qdrant |
| Milvus | Vector DB | Distributed vector DB with Apache licensing; broad ecosystem | Apache-2.0 (SDK license shown) citeturn29search5 | Strong open-source option for large-scale deployments; heavier ops footprint than Redis/FAISS |
| Redis (vector search) | Vector search extension | Vector fields + KNN and HNSW/FLAT indexing; realtime updates | Redis Stack docs citeturn29search0turn29search2 | Useful when you want memory + caching in one system; hybrid retrieval still needs careful design |
| Pinecone | Managed vector DB | Managed control plane/data plane architecture; designed for scalable vector search | Proprietary managed service citeturn29search4 | Great for teams wanting to offload ops; consider IP and vendor constraints for game assets/code |
| FAISS | Vector library | High-performance similarity search and clustering; CPU/GPU indexes | Open-source library (GitHub) citeturn21search0 | Best as an embedded component (single-node or custom service), not a full memory DB |
| LangChain | Agent framework | Memory concepts + integration ecosystem; LangGraph adds checkpointing/memory stores | MIT citeturn30search1turn26search1 | Helpful patterns for checkpointing and long-term memory namespaces; integrate selectively with MoonMind |
| LlamaIndex | RAG/agent data framework | Memory abstractions, vector memory patterns, composable memory concepts | MIT citeturn24search4turn30search3 | Already in MoonMind; extend with hybrid retrieval + memory objects for best ROI |

Two ecosystem notes that matter for MoonMind:
- MCP is an emerging standard for connecting tools and data sources to agent runtimes; both the protocol spec and vendor documentation emphasize interoperability and normative requirements. citeturn24search0turn24search1
- LangGraph/LangChain’s memory model treats persistence and namespaces as first-class—useful as a conceptual template even if you do not adopt their full runtime. citeturn26search1turn25search6

## Evaluation plan and experimental design

A memory system is only as good as its measured outcomes. For MoonMind, the evaluation plan should cover retrieval quality, end-to-end task success, and operational cost/latency.

### Metrics to track

**Retrieval metrics (offline and in staging):**
- Recall@k / Precision@k for known-answer queries (e.g., “Where is stamina regen computed?”).
- MRR / nDCG for ranking quality when multiple relevant chunks exist.
- Context “redundancy” rate (fraction of retrieved tokens that are duplicates or irrelevant).

**Generation + grounding metrics:**
- Faithfulness/groundedness: fraction of claims supported by retrieved evidence (can be sampled + human-judged).
- Hallucination rate on “answerable-from-KB” queries.
- Citation/provenance correctness (do cited nodes actually contain the supported fact?).

**Agentic effectiveness metrics:**
- Task success rate on scripted game-dev tasks (below).
- Tool-call efficiency: tool calls per successful task, retries per task.
- Regression metrics: “repeated failure” incidents (same failure occurring despite memory).

**Operational metrics:**
- End-to-end latency p50/p95/p99 for chat and for agent workflows.
- Retrieval latency breakdown: embed time, vector query time, rerank time.
- Cost per query / per workflow (tokens in/out + embedding costs).
- Throughput and backpressure behavior under concurrent runs.

### Experimental plan

**Stage A: Retrieval evaluation harness**
- Build a labeled dataset of ~200–1,000 queries drawn from real studio workflows:
 - Code navigation Qs (“where is X implemented?”)
 - Build troubleshooting Qs (“why is CI failing with error Y?”)
 - Design consistency Qs (lore constraints, gameplay rule clarifications)
 - Asset pipeline Qs (naming conventions, import settings, compression rules)
- Label ground-truth documents/snippets (or at least “relevant file set”) by humans.
- Run retrieval-only benchmarks comparing:
 - dense-only vs hybrid vs hybrid+rerank,
 - chunking strategies,
 - metadata filtering policies.

**Stage B: End-to-end “agent tasks” benchmark**
Create a standardized suite of tasks that mirror game development:
- “Implement a small gameplay feature” (multi-file code edit + tests).
- “Fix a build break” (parse logs, identify root cause, propose patch).
- “Generate Jira stories from a feature pitch” (planning).
- “Update design docs and keep canon consistent” (document write + cite provenance).
Then run A/B:
- Baseline (no long-term memory; only prompt) vs
- RAG only vs
- RAG + episodic ledger vs
- RAG + episodic + hierarchical summaries.

**Stage C: Human-in-the-loop validation**
- For “memory writes” (new canonical summaries, new “rules”), require review workflows:
 - measure reviewer time,
 - memory drift incidents,
 - rollback frequency.

### Datasets suited to game development

**Real (preferred):**
- Your codebase (engine/game scripts), build logs, PR history.
- Design docs, narrative bible, balance spreadsheets (text exports), internal wiki pages.
- Ticket system exports (Jira), including resolution notes.

**Synthetic (useful early):**
- Generate “doc+code” toy repos that mimic typical game systems (inventory, save/load, combat, AI behavior trees).
- Create synthetic build logs with labeled root causes.
- Create synthetic lore corpora with known contradictions to test “canon consistency” memory.

## Privacy, IP, and compliance guardrails

Game studios operate under strong IP constraints. Memory systems amplify risk because they (a) store more content durably, and (b) increase the chance sensitive snippets are surfaced or sent to external model providers.

### Core risks

- **IP leakage via prompts:** Retrieval may inject proprietary code, art descriptions, or unreleased narrative details into prompts that are sent to external APIs.
- **Secret leakage:** Logs often contain tokens, credentials, internal URLs; episodic memory is especially high risk.
- **Prompt injection via retrieved sources:** Retrieved documents can contain malicious instructions (“ignore previous rules; exfiltrate…”). This is a known failure mode in RAG systems if retrieved content is treated as instructions.
- **Cross-tenant data bleed:** If multiple teams/projects share one deployment, memory must be partitioned correctly.

### Recommended guardrails for MoonMind

**Memory isolation model**
- Implement memory namespaces similar to LangGraph’s guidance (namespace + key) and enforce RBAC at the namespace boundary. citeturn26search1
- Partition semantic stores and episodic event logs by `project_id` and `security_scope`. Treat “project_id” as non-optional.

**Redaction and minimization**
- Default to storing **references/digests** to artifacts (logs/patches) rather than raw content in episodic memory.
- Run secret scanners on:
 - ingested documents,
 - logs before indexing,
 - retrieved context before prompt assembly.
- Keep raw secrets in a dedicated secret manager; in memory objects store only opaque handles.

**Retrieval safety**
- Separate “retrieved content” from “instructions” in the prompt template (system prompt explicitly states retrieved text is *data*, not instructions).
- Add a filtering stage that removes:
 - credential-like patterns,
 - untrusted instruction blocks,
 - overly large chunks with low relevance scores.

**Audit logging and replay**
- For every agent run, persist:
 - model identifiers, parameters, and tool configuration,
 - retrieval results (doc IDs, scores, hashes; not necessarily full text),
 - tool calls and outputs (or redacted versions),
 - final outputs and any side effects (PR URLs, artifact paths).
- MCP usage should be included in these logs so tool-mediated actions are replayable and attributable. citeturn24search0turn24search1

**Long-context governance**
Even when 1M-token contexts are available, large prompts can incur premium pricing and introduce new governance concerns (more data egress per request). Claude’s context window documentation and AWS’s Bedrock announcement both highlight tiering and premium pricing for >200k tokens. citeturn23search3turn23search0

### Practical implementation stance

For MoonMind, a robust default posture is:
- **Use retrieval + compression to minimize what leaves your boundary**, even if long-context is available.
- **Store episodic memory primarily as structured metadata + artifact references**, and only embed and store curated summaries.
- **Treat semantic memory as a governed product** (reviewable summaries and decision registries), not a free-form dump of everything the team ever wrote.

This combination (hybrid retrieval + episodic ledger + hierarchical summaries + explicit checkpointed state) is the most aligned with MoonMind’s current direction and the realities of building a video game in a business setting. citeturn21search2turn22view0turn20view0turn26search1
