Delivery centers on a Python 3.11 worker that mounts the repo and Docker socket, executes Compose commands for a single target service, and persists run metadata plus artifacts for MoonMind operators.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Context\\r\\n\\r\\n**Language/Version**: Python 3.11 runtime inside the orchestrator container plus POSIX shell for invoking Docker Compose.\\r\\n**Primary Dependencies**: Docker CLI + Compose plugin, Celery 5.4 task runner, RabbitMQ 3.x broker, PostgreSQL result backend, StatsD-compatible metrics sink.\\r\\n**Storage**: Local spec workflow artifacts under `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>` and PostgreSQL tables (`spec_workflow_runs`, `spec_workflow_task_states`) for run/step status.\\r\\n**Testing**: Compose-based integration tests that spin up RabbitMQ, Celery worker, API, and orchestrator containers plus focused unit tests for ActionPlan logic (per Phase 0 research).\\r\\n**Target Platform**: Single Linux host (or small pool) running Docker with docker-compose, using Docker-outside-of-Docker via mounted `/var/run/docker.sock`.\\r\\n**Project Type**: Backend automation service added to the existing MoonMind services stack plus supporting Celery workers.\\r\\n**Performance Goals**: Per spec, 90% of successful runs must complete patch -> verify within 20 minutes and 95% must emit a complete artifact set retrievable within 1 minute of completion.\\r\\n**Constraints**: Must obey file-level allow list, respect approval gates for protected services, restrict service restarts to target container only, and operate without Kubernetes.\\r\\n**Scale/Scope**: Start with one orchestrator worker processing runs sequentially per host, with the option to add workers later once service-level locking is in place.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Constitution Check\\r\\n\\r\\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\\r\\n\\r\\n`.specify/memory/constitution.md` is still a placeholder with no enforceable principles, so there are no concrete gates to evaluate. Record: **PASS – Constitution pending definition**. Once the constitution is populated, revisit this feature for retroactive compliance.\\r\\n**Post-Phase-1 Recheck (2025-11-13)**: Design outputs (research, data model, contracts, quickstart) introduce no extra projects or tooling beyond the placeholder constitution, so status remains **PASS**.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project Structure\\r\\n\\r\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\r\\n\\r\\n```text\\r\\nspecs/005-orchestrator-architecture/\\r\\n├── plan.md              # /speckit.plan output (this file)\\r\\n├── spec.md              # Approved feature specification\\r\\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 research log\\r\\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 entity + validation design\\r\\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 operational onboarding guide\\r\\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 API contracts (OpenAPI)\\r\\n└── checklists/          # Specification quality artifacts from /speckit.specify\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\r\\n\\r\\n```text\\r\\ndocker-compose.yaml               # Defines api, celery worker, supporting services\\r\\ndocker-compose.job.yaml           # Job-oriented overrides (future orchestrator service goes here)\\r\\nmoonmind/                         # Core Python package (planning, workflows, utils)\\r\\napi_service/                      # HTTP entrypoint service\\r\\ncelery_worker/                    # Existing worker container build context\\r\\nspec_tools/ (future)              # <-- new orchestrator package under moonmind/workflows/orchestrator\\r\\nservices/orchestrator/            # <-- new container context with Dockerfile + entrypoint\\r\\ntests/\\r\\n├── integration/\\r\\n│   └── orchestrator/             # <-- new compose-driven verification suites\\r\\n└── unit/\\r\\nvar/artifacts/spec_workflows/     # Run-scoped artifact storage mount\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Structure Decision**: Extend the compose stack with a dedicated `services/orchestrator/` build context that mounts the repo into `/workspace`, add a Python package (e.g., `moonmind.workflows.orchestrator`) for ActionPlan logic plus Celery tasks, and introduce an integration test directory under `tests/integration/orchestrator` to exercise patch/build/relaunch flows using the standard compose stack.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Complexity Tracking\\r\\n\\r\\nNo constitution-defined violations identified; table intentionally left empty pending a finalized governance document.\\r\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

MoonMind Orchestrator Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n**Feature Branch**: `005-orchestrator-architecture`\\r\\n**Created**: 2025-11-13\\r\\n**Status**: Draft\\r\\n**Input**: User description: \\\"Create a spec which will implement the orchestrator architecture defined by docsOrchestratorArchitecture.md\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\r\\n\\r\\n### User Story 1 - Autonomous Fix Run (Priority: P1)\\r\\n\\r\\nMoonMind operator submits a high-level instruction such as \\\"repair missing dependency for the API service,\\\" and the orchestrator analyzes logs, proposes a patch to allowed files, rebuilds the target image, restarts the affected service, and validates health without requiring the operator to touch Docker commands manually.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why this priority**: Delivers the core value: translating intent into a repeatable build/relaunch cycle that keeps services healthy with minimal operator time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Independent Test**: Provide a controlled failing service, trigger one orchestrator run, and verify it produces a patch, rebuilds only the targeted service, restarts it, and records verification artifacts end-to-end.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Given** a reproducible failure with clear logs, **When** the operator launches an orchestrator run, **Then** the system outputs a structured ActionPlan, applies an allowed file patch, and persists the resulting diff for review.\\r\\n2. **Given** a successful rebuild + restart, **When** the orchestrator performs the configured health checks, **Then** it marks the run successful only after container state and HTTP health checks pass within the allowed time window.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### User Story 2 - Run Visibility & Audit (Priority: P2)\\r\\n\\r\\nOperators need to inspect ongoing and historical runs to see what the orchestrator changed, which Docker commands were executed, and how health verification progressed so they can trust automated fixes or intervene quickly.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why this priority**: Without transparent status, operators cannot approve or troubleshoot automated remediation, undermining adoption.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Independent Test**: Trigger a run while observing the operator interface/log store and confirm that each action emits timestamps, command summaries, artifacts (diff, build log, health log), and final disposition.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Given** an in-progress run, **When** an operator opens the run record, **Then** they see step-level status (plan, patch, build, restart, verify, rollback) with links to stored artifacts.\\r\\n2. **Given** a failed verification, **When** the operator inspects the run, **Then** the orchestrator exposes failure cause, rollback result, and the exact files touched so manual remediation can continue safely.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### User Story 3 - Policy-Governed Rollback & Approvals (Priority: P3)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an instruction targets sensitive services or a verification step fails, the orchestrator must honor approval gates, automatically rollback to the prior state, and document what happened so the change can be re-reviewed.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why this priority**: Safeguards production stability by ensuring automation never leaves services in an unknown state and enforces human approvals on high-risk assets.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Independent Test**: Configure a policy that requires approval for the API service, trigger a run without approval and another run whose verification fails, and confirm the system blocks the first and rolls back the second while recording evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Given** a protected service without recorded approval, **When** the orchestrator receives an instruction to modify it, **Then** the run halts before editing files and emits an approval-needed status.\\r\\n2. **Given** a run that fails health checks, **When** rollback executes, **Then** the orchestrator reverts touched files, restarts the prior image, and marks the run as rolled back with the failure reason documented.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Edge Cases\\r\\n\\r\\n- Docker daemon or socket unavailable: orchestrator must fail fast, log the infrastructure issue, and skip any patching to avoid partial changes.\\r\\n- Instruction targets a service missing from `docker-compose.yml`: run should validate service names upfront and return an actionable error before altering files.\\r\\n- Health endpoint never becomes ready within the timeout: orchestrator must attempt rollback once, then mark the run failed with references to verification logs.\\r\\n- Approval received mid-run: system should resume the blocked step without re-running earlier successful steps, provided artifacts remain valid.\\r\\n- Log or artifact storage unavailable: run should continue core remediation but flag missing artifacts so operators can rerun once storage is restored.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\r\\n\\r\\n### Functional Requirements\\r\\n\\r\\n- **FR-001**: The orchestrator must run as a dedicated service (mm-orchestrator) within the existing docker-compose project, mounting the repository workspace and host Docker socket as described in `docs/OrchestratorArchitecture.md`.\\r\\n- **FR-002**: Each run must accept a high-level instruction, derive or validate the target service, and expand it into a structured ActionPlan with explicit steps (analyze, patch, build, restart, verify, rollback).\\r\\n- **FR-003**: The orchestrator must restrict file edits to the approved allow list (service Dockerfiles and dependency manifests) and block all other filesystem changes unless a policy override exists.\\r\\n- **FR-004**: Patch generation must capture diffs before and after modifications, store them as artifacts per run, and expose the diff path to operators for audit.\\r\\n- **FR-005**: Builds must be executed through the Compose control plane for only the targeted service while streaming build output to storage so operators can review compiler or dependency results.\\r\\n- **FR-006**: Service restarts must redeploy only the targeted service via Compose's dependency-skipping semantics and confirm that all other containers remain untouched.\\r\\n- **FR-007**: Verification must include at least container-state checks plus configurable HTTP health probes with backoff and a maximum wait time, marking the run failed if any probe does not succeed.\\r\\n- **FR-008**: When verification fails, the orchestrator must execute rollback by reverting touched files, rebuilding if needed, restarting the previous image, and documenting the rollback outcome.\\r\\n- **FR-009**: Approval policies must be enforced before the patch step, requiring affirmative approval records for protected services and logging the approver identity with timestamps.\\r\\n- **FR-010**: Every step in the run lifecycle must emit structured status updates (state, timestamp, key message, artifact references) so MoonMind's UI and logs can present real-time progress.\\r\\n- **FR-011**: The orchestrator must persist per-run artifacts inside the designated spec workflow artifact store (default `spec_workflows` namespace), covering diffs, build logs, compose outputs, health logs, and rollback notes.\\r\\n- **FR-012**: Metrics counters and timers (e.g., runs attempted, success/failure counts, verification duration, rollback frequency) must be emitted via the configured StatsD endpoint when `STATSD_HOST/PORT` or `SPEC_WORKFLOW_METRICS_*` are set.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\r\\n\\r\\n- **OrchestratorRun**: Represents a single instruction execution; stores run ID, instruction text, target service, timestamps per step, approval references, and final status.\\r\\n- **ActionPlan**: Structured list of ordered steps with parameters (files to edit, build targets, health URLs, rollback strategy) generated before execution and updated as steps complete.\\r\\n- **RunArtifact**: Metadata record pointing to stored diffs, build logs, verification logs, and rollback reports, including checksum and retention info for audit trails.\\r\\n- **ApprovalGate**: Policy record that defines which services require approval, acceptable approver roles, and the validity window of an approval token referenced by runs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\r\\n\\r\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\r\\n\\r\\n- **SC-001**: 90% of successful orchestrator runs complete patch -> verify within 20 minutes for single-service fixes using the documented orchestrator workflow.\\r\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of runs touching protected services either include a valid approval record before patching begins or are blocked with an approval-required status.\\r\\n- **SC-003**: 95% of runs produce a complete artifact set (diff, build log, health log, rollback log when applicable) retrievable by operators within 1 minute of run completion.\\r\\n- **SC-004**: Automation reduces manual intervention for targeted service recovery by at least 60% per month, measured by operator-reported manual command counts compared to the prior baseline.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Assumptions & Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n- RabbitMQ broker, Celery worker, and MoonMind API service are already running per the Spec Workflow Verification Checklist so orchestrator tasks can be queued and monitored.\\r\\n- Host Docker daemon access via `/var/run/docker.sock` remains available and secured; orchestrator runs on trusted hosts where this access is acceptable.\\r\\n- Service health endpoints (or equivalent checks) are documented so verification can be configured without further discovery.\\r\\n- Secrets such as GitHub and Codex tokens are provided through environment variables or Docker secrets and are masked in logs.\\r\\n- The spec workflow artifact storage location (local directory or object store namespace) has sufficient capacity and backup to retain logs for auditing periods.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope Boundaries\\r\\n\\r\\n- Feature focuses on orchestrating Docker Compose environments; migrating to Kubernetes or adding blue/green routing is explicitly out of scope.\\r\\n- Log analysis may leverage existing MoonMind tooling or LLM helpers but designing new diagnostic AI models is not part of this effort.\\r\\n- Manual PR creation or CI integration beyond storing diffs is excluded; those workflows remain manual or handled by other specs.\\r\\n- Multi-service coordinated deployments (restart of multiple services simultaneously) are deferred until orchestration maturity is proven on single-service runs.\\r\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

stores run ID, instruction text, target service, timestamps per step, approval references, and final status.\\r\\n- **ActionPlan**: Structured list of ordered steps with parameters (files to edit, build targets, health URLs, rollback strategy) generated before execution and updated as steps complete.\\r\\n- **RunArtifact**: Metadata record pointing to stored diffs, build logs, verification logs, and rollback reports, including checksum and retention info for audit trails.\\r\\n- **ApprovalGate**: Policy record that defines which services require approval, acceptable approver roles, and the validity window of an approval token referenced by runs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\r\\n\\r\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\r\\n\\r\\n- **SC-001**: 90% of successful orchestrator runs complete patch -> verify within 20 minutes for single-service fixes using the documented orchestrator workflow.\\r\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of runs touching protected services either include a valid approval record before patching begins or are blocked with an approval-required status.\\r\\n- **SC-003**: 95% of runs produce a complete artifact set (diff, build log, health log, rollback log when applicable) retrievable by operators within 1 minute of run completion.\\r\\n- **SC-004**: Automation reduces manual intervention for targeted service recovery by at least 60% per month, measured by operator-reported manual command counts compared to the prior baseline.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Assumptions & Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n- RabbitMQ broker, Celery worker, and MoonMind API service are already running per the Spec Workflow Verification Checklist so orchestrator tasks can be queued and monitored.\\r\\n- Host Docker daemon access via `/var/run/docker.sock` remains available and secured; orchestrator runs on trusted hosts where this access is acceptable.\\r\\n- Service health endpoints (or equivalent checks) are documented so verification can be configured without further discovery.\\r\\n- Secrets such as GitHub and Codex tokens are provided through environment variables or Docker secrets and are masked in logs.\\r\\n- The spec workflow artifact storage location (local directory or object store namespace) has sufficient capacity and backup to retain logs for auditing periods.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Scope Boundaries\\r\\n\\r\\n- Feature focuses on orchestrating Docker Compose environments; migrating to Kubernetes or adding blue/green routing is explicitly out of scope.\\r\\n- Log analysis may leverage existing MoonMind tooling or LLM helpers but designing new diagnostic AI models is not part of this effort.\\r\\n- Manual PR creation or CI integration beyond storing diffs is excluded; those workflows remain manual or handled by other specs.\\r\\n- Multi-service coordinated deployments (restart of multiple services simultaneously) are deferred until orchestration maturity is proven on single-service runs.\\r\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Testing strategy for mm-orchestrator\\r\\n- **Decision**: Validate orchestrator behavior through docker-compose-based integration tests that spin up RabbitMQ, the dedicated Celery worker, and the API service (`docker compose up rabbitmq celery-worker api orchestrator-test`) plus targeted unit tests for ActionPlan logic.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: The feature’s success criteria hinge on verifying patch/build/relaunch flows exactly as they run in production; composing the same stack in CI ensures Docker commands, allow lists, approvals, and artifact writes behave correctly. Lightweight unit tests keep ActionPlan decision trees fast to iterate.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: (a) Only unit tests inside the Python package—rejected because they cannot validate Docker socket interactions or compose semantics. (b) Manually triggered end-to-end tests after deployment—rejected because they delay regression detection and violate the “autonomous fix” promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Expected run concurrency / worker capacity\\r\\n- **Decision**: Start with a single orchestrator Celery worker per host (sequential run processing) while allowing horizontal scaling later by running additional worker containers behind the same queue.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Compose is operating against a single Docker daemon; serializing runs prevents interleaved builds/restarts from stepping on each other. Celery still provides the option to scale by adding workers once safeguards like service-level locking and resource quotas are implemented.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: (a) Immediately allow multiple workers—rejected due to risk of concurrent builds restarting the same service simultaneously. (b) Enforce concurrency purely via database locking—deferred until instrumentation proves the need.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dependency Best Practices\\r\\n\\r\\n### Docker CLI + Compose plugin\\r\\n- **Decision**: Invoke Compose with explicit project name (`--project-name moonmind`) and service scoping (`build <service>`, `up -d --no-deps <service>`) while streaming stdout/stderr to per-run log files.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Explicit project names keep orchestrator runs isolated even if multiple compose files exist; scoping prevents unintended restarts. Capturing the raw command output fulfills audit and rollback requirements.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Using ad-hoc `docker build`/`docker run` commands was rejected because it diverges from existing MoonMind operations and complicates Compose dependency management.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Celery 5.4 task runner\\r\\n- **Decision**: Model each orchestrator step (analyze, patch, build, restart, verify, rollback) as dedicated Celery tasks chained via signatures so MoonMind UI can observe per-step states.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Aligns with current Spec Workflow architecture (Celery Chains) and allows retries/resumes at the failing step, matching requirements for transparency and auditability.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: A monolithic long-running task was rejected because it hides intermediate progress and complicates retries.\\r\\n\\r\\n### StatsD metrics emission\\r\\n- **Decision**: Wrap run lifecycle events in a thin instrumentation layer that emits counters/timers when `STATSD_HOST/PORT` or `SPEC_WORKFLOW_METRICS_*` are configured, and degrade gracefully (log-only) when unset.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Keeps instrumentation optional yet consistent; ensures no runs fail due to missing StatsD while still collecting MTTR metrics when available.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Mandatory metrics configuration—rejected to avoid blocking local development; ignoring metrics entirely—rejected because success criteria depend on operational insight.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artifact storage (filesystem/object store)\\r\\n- **Decision**: Use the established `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>` directory mounted into the orchestrator container, with file naming conventions (`patch.diff`, `build.log`, `verify.log`, `rollback.log`) and checksum recording in the run metadata.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Reuses the path referenced in existing Spec Workflow tooling and keeps artifacts colocated with other runs for easier operator access and retention policies.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Introducing a new object store bucket now—rejected as unnecessary initial complexity; storing artifacts only in the database—rejected due to log size.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Integration Patterns\\r\\n\\r\\n### RabbitMQ broker\\r\\n- **Decision**: Reuse the existing RabbitMQ instance defined in `docker-compose.yaml`, placing mm-orchestrator tasks on a dedicated queue (e.g., `orchestrator.run`) with `prefetch_count=1` to enforce sequential execution.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Keeps infrastructure consistent with current Celery deployments while allowing workload isolation via queue naming and QoS settings.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Provisioning a separate broker—rejected for initial scope; using Redis as a broker—rejected because the stack standardizes on RabbitMQ.\\r\\n\\r\\n### PostgreSQL result backend\\r\\n- **Decision**: Persist run/step state in the existing `spec_workflow_runs` and `spec_workflow_task_states` tables, adding orchestrator-specific fields (approval id, artifact paths, rollback outcome) as needed.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Satisfies the requirement to surface orchestrator progress inside the MoonMind UI and avoids duplicating persistence layers.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Creating new tables just for orchestrator—rejected because Spec Workflow history already tracks similar data; writing only to the filesystem—rejected because structured status queries are required.\\r\\n\\r\\n### MoonMind API + approvals\\r\\n- **Decision**: Extend the API so operators can submit instructions, provide approvals, and fetch run artifacts; the orchestrator will call back into the API to update run states and honor approval tokens before editing files.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Centralizes operator interaction in the existing MoonMind UI/API surface while fulfilling policy enforcement.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Direct CLI-only approvals—rejected to keep workflows discoverable within MoonMind.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Service health endpoints\\r\\n- **Decision**: Require each target service to expose a documented health URL (e.g., `/health` via API container networking); orchestrator health checks will poll the service hostname inside the compose network with exponential backoff and a configurable timeout.\\r\\n- **Rationale**: Matches the verification steps defined in the spec and avoids coupling to hostnames outside the compose network; exponential backoff balances readiness wait vs. failure detection.\\r\\n- **Alternatives considered**: Relying solely on container state (`docker ps`)—rejected because it misses application-level readiness; hitting public ingress endpoints—rejected because orchestrator runs inside the compose network.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Outcomes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Testing and scale uncertainties are resolved: integration tests will exercise the full compose stack, and orchestrator runs process sequentially per worker with the option to add more workers later.\\r\\n- Dependency best practices ensure Docker/Celery/StatsD/artifact handling align with existing MoonMind operations.\\r\\n- Integration patterns define how the orchestrator uses RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MoonMind APIs, and service health endpoints, providing the blueprint required for Phase 1 design deliverables.\\r\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Ensure PostgreSQL migrations for `spec_workflow_runs` and `spec_workflow_task_states` are up to date (existing Spec Workflow requirement).\\r\\n4. Bring up RabbitMQ, Celery worker, and API as noted in the Spec Workflow Verification Checklist:\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   docker compose up rabbitmq celery-worker api -d\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Run the orchestrator container locally\\r\\n1. Add the new service to `docker-compose.yaml` (see plan) and build it:\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   docker compose build orchestrator\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n2. Start the orchestrator with repository + Docker socket mounted:\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   docker compose up orchestrator -d\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n3.

Integration\\r\\n\\r\\n**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-celery-chain-workflow/`\\r\\n**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/\\r\\n\\r\\n**Tests**: Automated tests are scoped where they directly verify Celery orchestration and API contracts referenced in the spec.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment is independently testable.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`\\r\\n- `[P]` indicates the task can run in parallel with others in the same phase.\\r\\n- `[US#]` labels tasks that belong to a specific user story.\\r\\n- All tasks cite concrete file paths derived from the implementation plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)\\r\\n**Purpose**: Ensure configuration scaffolding exists before touching schema or workflow code.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] T001 [P] Add Spec workflow queue + artifact defaults to `.env-template`, `.env.vllm-template`, and `config.toml` so operators can set `SPEC_WORKFLOW_CODEX_QUEUE`, `SPEC_WORKFLOW_ARTIFACT_ROOT`, and Celery broker URLs.\\r\\n- [x] T002 Wire the new settings into `moonmind/config/settings.py` and `api_service/config.template.toml` so API services and workers can read queue + artifact paths.\\r\\n- [x] T003 [P] Update `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.job.yaml` Celery worker definitions to bind the `codex` queue and mount `var/artifacts/spec_workflows` for Codex log persistence.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)\\r\\n**Purpose**: Create database entities, repositories, and Celery configuration required by every story. ⚠️ Do not start story work until these tasks finish.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] T004 Create Alembic migration `api_service/migrations/versions/<timestamp>_spec_workflow_chain.py` adding `spec_workflow_runs`, `spec_workflow_task_states`, `workflow_credential_audits`, and `workflow_artifacts` per `data-model.md`.\\r\\n- [ ] T005 Update ORM models in `api_service/db/models.py` so SQLAlchemy knows about the new tables, FKs, and relationships.\\r\\n- [ ] T006 Implement persistence helpers in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/repositories.py` to insert/update runs, task states, artifacts, and credential audits transactionally.\\r\\n- [ ] T007 Expand Pydantic schemas in `moonmind/schemas/workflow_models.py` and serializers in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/serializers.py` to match the contract outputs.\\r\\n- [ ] T008 Add artifact storage utilities in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/storage.py` (new file) that normalize `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>` paths, file metadata, and digests.\\r\\n- [ ] T009 Configure the single `codex` queue plus QoS defaults inside `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/celeryconfig.py` and ensure `celery_worker/speckit_worker.py` consumes those settings on startup.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Checkpoint**: Database + serialization + Celery plumbing ready for user stories.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 – Trigger Next Spec Phase (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\\r\\n**Goal**: Operators run “next Spec Kit phase” and a Celery chain executes discovery → submit → apply → publish while persisting artifacts and Codex context.\\r\\n**Independent Test**: POST `/api/workflows/speckit/runs` against a staging repo and verify a branch/PR plus Codex logs are created without manual steps.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tests (write before implementation)\\r\\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Add Celery-chain happy-path coverage to `tests/unit/workflows/test_tasks.py`, asserting discovery/submit/apply/publish states populate the DB.\\r\\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Add contract coverage for `POST /api/workflows/speckit/runs` in `tests/contract/test_workflow_api.py`, checking 202 payload shape and idempotent branch names.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Implementation\\r\\n- [ ] T012 [US1] Build the Celery chain/orchestrator in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/__init__.py`, composing immutable signatures and saving `AsyncResult` IDs onto `SpecWorkflowRun`.\\r\\n- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement discovery, submit, apply/poll, publish, and finalize tasks with artifact writes inside `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/tasks.py`.\\r\\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Create Codex/GitHub helper functions in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/services.py` to enforce idempotent branch naming, push commits, and capture JSONL log paths.\\r\\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Wire `POST /api/workflows/speckit/runs` inside `api_service/api/routers/workflows.py` to validate input, create `SpecWorkflowRun`, and enqueue the chain.\\r\\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Update worker bootstrap scripts (`celery_worker/speckit_worker.py` and `celery_worker/scripts/codex_login_proxy.py`) to run Codex preflight checks and mount the configured auth volume before tasks start.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Checkpoint**: Triggering a run now creates branches/PRs and stores Codex artifacts automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 – Monitor Workflow Progress (Priority: P2)\\r\\n**Goal**: Operators view real-time run status, task-by-task state, and artifact metadata via API responses.\\r\\n**Independent Test**: While a run executes, poll `GET /api/workflows/speckit/runs/{id}` and `/runs/{id}/tasks` to confirm timestamps, payloads, and artifacts update; induce a failure to verify actionable messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Tests\\r\\n- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Extend `tests/unit/workflows/test_tasks.py` to confirm each Celery state change writes `SpecWorkflowTaskState` with timestamps + artifact references.\\r\\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Add contract tests for `GET /api/workflows/speckit/runs`, `/runs/{id}`, `/runs/{id}/tasks`, and `/runs/{id}/artifacts` in `tests/contract/test_workflow_api.py`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Implementation\\r\\n- [ ] T019 [US2] Implement run listing/filtering + task-state fetchers in `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/repositories.py`, including cursor pagination and error handling.\\r\\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Enhance `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/serializers.py` to embed task states, credential audit info, and artifacts per the OpenAPI schema.\\r\\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Add GET handlers for runs, run detail, task states, and artifacts inside `api_service/api/routers/workflows.py`, enforcing auth + query validation.\\r\\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Update `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/tasks.py` to emit structured status snapshots (state, timestamps, payload refs) into `SpecWorkflowTaskState`.\\r\\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Document monitoring workflows (API polling + expected logs) in `specs/001-celery-chain-workflow/quickstart.md` and `docs/SpecKitAutomation.md`.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Checkpoint**: Operators can rely on the API to observe progress and download artifacts.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 – Retry or Resume Failed Chains (Priority: P3)\\r\\n**Goal**: Resume failed chains from the blocking task (when safe) or restart cleanly after fixing credentials, preserving artifacts.\\r\\n**Independent Test**: Force a failure at publish, POST `/api/workflows/speckit/runs/{id}/retry`, and confirm the chain resumes using stored diff context; retry again without fixing credentials to ensure fast failure with guidance.\\r\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Begin Patch\n*** Add File: specs/005-orchestrator-architecture/tasks.md\n+# Tasks: MoonMind Orchestrator Implementation\n+\n+**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-orchestrator-architecture/`\n+**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/\n+\n+**Tests**: Compose-based integration tests, Celery step unit tests, and orchestrator API contract tests are required to confirm patch/build/restart automation, artifact retention, and approval enforcement per the spec.\n+\n+**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment is independently testable.\n+\n+## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`\n+- `[P]` indicates the task can run in parallel with others in the same phase.\n+- `[US#]` labels tasks that belong to a specific user story.\n+- All tasks cite concrete file paths derived from the implementation plan.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)\n+**Purpose**: Establish configuration scaffolding and container build context for the orchestrator service before wiring application code.\n+\n+- [ ] T001 Add mm-orchestrator environment defaults (queue names, StatsD host/port, artifact root) to `.env-template`, `.env.vllm-template`, and `config.toml` so services share the same knobs.\n+- [ ] T002 Update `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.job.yaml` to define the `orchestrator` service with `/workspace` and `/var/run/docker.sock` mounts, broker/result backend env vars, and dependency ordering with rabbitmq/api.\n+- [ ] T003 Create the container context in `services/orchestrator/Dockerfile`, `services/orchestrator/requirements.txt`, and `services/orchestrator/entrypoint.sh` to install Python 3.11, Celery 5.4, compose CLI, and bootstrap the dedicated worker process.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)\n+**Purpose**: Provide database schema, serialization, persistence utilities, and Celery configuration that all user stories rely on. ⚠️ Do not start story work until these tasks finish.\n+\n+- [ ] T004 Create an Alembic migration `api_service/migrations/versions/<timestamp>_add_orchestrator_tables.py` that adds `orchestrator_runs`, `orchestrator_action_plans`, `orchestrator_run_artifacts`, `approval_gates`, and links into `spec_workflow_task_states` per `data-model.md`.\n+- [ ] T005 Extend SQLAlchemy models and enums in `api_service/db/models.py` (and related `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/models.py` if reused) to represent OrchestratorRun, ActionPlan, RunArtifact, ApprovalGate, and approval/status fields consumed by Celery state tracking.\n+- [ ] T006 Add orchestrator request/response schemas in `moonmind/schemas/workflow_models.py` plus API response plumbing in `api_service/api/schemas.py` so routers and workers share typed payloads.\n+- [ ] T007 Implement persistence helpers and artifact storage utilities in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/repositories.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/storage.py` to create runs, snapshot plan steps, and manage `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>/`.\n+- [ ] T008 Configure the Celery app + instrumentation baseline by adding `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/celeryconfig.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/metrics.py`, then updating `services/orchestrator/entrypoint.sh` to load the config and StatsD hooks.\n+\n+**Checkpoint**: Database, schemas, repositories, and worker scaffolding are ready for user stories.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 3: User Story 1 – Autonomous Fix Run (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\n+**Goal**: Accept an instruction, plan patch/build/restart steps for a target compose service, and execute the chain while storing artifacts.\n+**Independent Test**: Trigger a failing service locally, POST `/orchestrator/runs`, and verify the run produces a diff, rebuilds only the target service, restarts it, and stores verify logs/artifacts end-to-end.\n+\n+### Tests for User Story 1\n+- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Add a compose-based integration test `tests/integration/orchestrator/test_autonomous_run.py` that simulates a dependency fix, asserts `analyze→patch→build→restart→verify` log entries, and checks artifacts under `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>/`.\n+\n+### Implementation for User Story 1\n+- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Define service metadata (allow-listed files, compose service names, health URLs) in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/service_profiles.py` so instructions can be validated up front.\n+- [ ] T010 [US1] Implement ActionPlan generation logic in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/action_plan.py` that expands instructions into analyze/patch/build/restart/verify steps with parameters.\n+- [ ] T011 [US1] Build the patch/build/restart command runner in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/command_runner.py`, including allow-list enforcement, compose invocations, and artifact writers for diffs/build logs.\n+- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement Celery step tasks and chaining in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/tasks.py` to execute the ActionPlan sequentially, update run status, and emit repository events.\n+- [ ] T013 [US1] Add the `POST /orchestrator/runs` endpoint plus router registration inside `api_service/api/routers/orchestrator.py` (and `api_service/main.py`) to validate requests, create OrchestratorRun rows, and enqueue the Celery chain.\n+\n+**Checkpoint**: Operators can queue autonomous fix runs that patch/build/restart services and persist artifacts without manual Docker commands.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 4: User Story 2 – Run Visibility & Audit (Priority: P2)\n+**Goal**: Provide APIs and instrumentation so operators can inspect run state, artifacts, and metrics while the chain executes.\n+**Independent Test**: Start a run, poll the listing/detail endpoints, and confirm each plan step exposes timestamps, messages, artifact links, and StatsD counters while failures show actionable errors.\n+\n+### Tests for User Story 2\n+- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Add orchestrator API/serializer tests in `tests/contract/test_orchestrator_api.py` and repository unit tests in `tests/unit/workflows/test_orchestrator_repository.py` covering run list/detail/artifact responses and filtering.\n+\n+### Implementation for User Story 2\n+- [ ] T015 [P] [US2] Implement run listing/detail queries plus serializer helpers inside `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/repositories.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/serializers.py`, including pagination/filter options.\n+- [ ] T016 [US2] Add `GET /orchestrator/runs` and `GET /orchestrator/runs/{run_id}` handlers in `api_service/api/routers/orchestrator.py` that call the new repository methods and enforce auth/query validation.\n+- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Implement `GET /orchestrator/runs/{run_id}/artifacts` in the same router to expose `RunArtifact` metadata and signed paths to files under `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>/`.\n+- [ ] T018 [US2] Enhance `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/tasks.py` so each Celery step writes `spec_workflow_task_states` rows with timestamps, Celery IDs, messages, and artifact references per `data-model.md`.\n+- [ ] T019 [US2] Emit StatsD counters/timers for run lifecycle events inside `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/metrics.py` and hook the calls into step transitions so monitoring reflects throughput and latency.\n+\n+**Checkpoint**: Operators and observability tooling can watch orchestrator runs progress with full artifact and metric trails.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 5: User Story 3 – Policy-Governed Rollback & Approvals (Priority: P3)\n+**Goal**: Enforce approval gates before riskier edits, perform rollbacks on failed verifications, and expose retry/approval APIs.\n+**Independent Test**: Configure a protected service, start a run without approval (expect `awaiting_approval`), provide approval to resume, then induce a verify failure to confirm rollback, artifact capture, and retry support.\n+\n+### Tests for User Story 3\n+- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Add integration coverage in `tests/integration/orchestrator/test_policy_and_rollback.py` proving approval enforcement, rollback artifacts, and retry flows, plus contract assertions for approval/retry endpoints.\n+\n+### Implementation for User Story 3\n+- [ ] T021 [US3] Implement approval policy resolution and validation helpers in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/policies.py`, and enforce them in run creation so protected services block before patching.\n+- [ ] T022 [US3] Add the `POST /orchestrator/runs/{run_id}/approvals` handler in `api_service/api/routers/orchestrator.py` plus repository updates to persist approval tokens, approver metadata, and unblock pending runs.\n+- [ ] T023 [US3] Extend `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/command_runner.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/tasks.py` with rollback execution (git revert/file restore, compose restart, rollback.log artifact) triggered on verify failure.\n+- [ ] T024 [US3] Implement `POST /orchestrator/runs/{run_id}/retry` in the router and Celery entry points so operators can resume from a stored plan step or queue a fresh chain that reuses artifacts.\n+\n+**Checkpoint**: Approval-sensitive services are protected, failures roll back automatically, and operators can approve or retry runs confidently.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n+**Purpose**: Finalize documentation, CI, and hardening across user stories.\n+\n+- [ ] T026 [P] Document orchestrator operations, approval flows, and StatsD dashboards in `docs/OrchestratorArchitecture.md`, `docs/SpecKitAutomation.md`, and refresh `specs/005-orchestrator-architecture/quickstart.md`.\n+- [ ] T027 Wire orchestrator integration jobs into CI by updating `docker-compose.test.yaml` and `.github/workflows/pytest-unit-tests.yml` so the new tests run in automation.\n+- [ ] T028 [P] Add log redaction + secret scrubbing hooks for orchestrator outputs inside `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/command_runner.py` and `moonmind/utils/logging.py` to keep artifacts audit-safe.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Dependencies & Execution Order\n+- **Setup (Phase 1)** must complete before schema or worker code can compile.\n+- **Foundational (Phase 2)** depends on Setup settings and blocks all user story phases.\n+- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)** starts after foundational work; it delivers the MVP experience.\n+- **User Story 2

execute autonomous fix runs with artifact capture; validate via the US1 integration test before moving on.\n+- **Incremental Delivery**: After MVP, layer in US2 visibility endpoints/tests so audit data is available without affecting run execution, then add US3 approval/rollback to protect sensitive services.\n+- **Parallelization**: Once Foundational tasks land, separate contributors can tackle US1 planning/command code, US2 API visibility, and US3 policy logic concurrently using the parallel task examples while coordinating on shared files.\n+- **Verification**: After each phase, run the quickstart Compose stack (`docker compose up rabbitmq celery-worker api orchestrator`) and targeted tests to confirm the feature slice is independently shippable.\n*** End Patch"}}

research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/\\n     5\\t\\n     6\\t**Tests**: Compose-based integration tests, Celery step unit tests, and orchestrator API contract tests are required to confirm patch/build/restart automation, artifact retention, and approval enforcement per the spec.\\n     7\\t\\n     8\\t**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment is independently testable.\\n     9\\t\\n    10\\t## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`\\n    11\\t- `[P]` indicates the task can run in parallel with others in the same phase.\\n    12\\t- `[US#]` labels tasks that belong to a specific user story.\\n    13\\t- All tasks cite concrete file paths derived from the implementation plan.\\n    14\\t\\n    15\\t---\\n    16\\t\\n    17\\t## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)\\n    18\\t**Purpose**: Establish configuration scaffolding and container build context for the orchestrator service before wiring application code.\\n    19\\t\\n    20\\t- [ ] T001 Add mm-orchestrator environment defaults (queue names, StatsD host/port, artifact root) to `.env-template`, `.env.vllm-template`, and `config.toml` so services share the same knobs.\\n    21\\t- [ ] T002 Update `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose.job.yaml` to define the `orchestrator` service with `/workspace` and `/var/run/docker.sock` mounts, broker/result backend env vars, and dependency ordering with rabbitmq/api.\\n    22\\t- [ ] T003 Create the container context in `services/orchestrator/Dockerfile`, `services/orchestrator/requirements.txt`, and `services/orchestrator/entrypoint.sh` to install Python 3.11, Celery 5.4, compose CLI, and bootstrap the dedicated worker process.\\n    23\\t\\n    24\\t---\\n    25\\t\\n    26\\t## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)\\n    27\\t**Purpose**: Provide database schema, serialization, persistence utilities, and Celery configuration that all user stories rely on. ⚠️ Do not start story work until these tasks finish.\\n    28\\t\\n    29\\t- [ ] T004 Create an Alembic migration `api_service/migrations/versions/<timestamp>_add_orchestrator_tables.py` that adds `orchestrator_runs`, `orchestrator_action_plans`, `orchestrator_run_artifacts`, `approval_gates`, and links into `spec_workflow_task_states` per `data-model.md`.\\n    30\\t- [ ] T005 Extend SQLAlchemy models and enums in `api_service/db/models.py` (and related `moonmind/workflows/speckit_celery/models.py` if reused) to represent OrchestratorRun, ActionPlan, RunArtifact, ApprovalGate, and approval/status fields consumed by Celery state tracking.\\n    31\\t- [ ] T006 Add orchestrator request/response schemas in `moonmind/schemas/workflow_models.py` plus API response plumbing in `api_service/api/schemas.py` so routers and workers share typed payloads.\\n    32\\t- [ ] T007 Implement persistence helpers and artifact storage utilities in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/repositories.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/storage.py` to create runs, snapshot plan steps, and manage `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>/`.\\n    33\\t- [ ] T008 Configure the Celery app + instrumentation baseline by adding `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/celeryconfig.py` and `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/metrics.py`, then updating `services/orchestrator/entrypoint.sh` to load the config and StatsD hooks.\\n    34\\t\\n    35\\t**Checkpoint**: Database, schemas, repositories, and worker scaffolding are ready for user stories.\\n    36\\t\\n    37\\t---\\n    38\\t\\n    39\\t## Phase 3: User Story 1 – Autonomous Fix Run (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\\n    40\\t**Goal**: Accept an instruction, plan patch/build/restart steps for a target compose service, and execute the chain while storing artifacts.\\n    41\\t**Independent Test**: Trigger a failing service locally, POST `/orchestrator/runs`, and verify the run produces a diff, rebuilds only the target service, restarts it, and stores verify logs/artifacts end-to-end.\\n    42\\t\\n    43\\t### Tests for User Story 1\\n    44\\t- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Add a compose-based integration test `tests/integration/orchestrator/test_autonomous_run.py` that simulates a dependency fix, asserts `analyze→patch→build→restart→verify` log entries, and checks artifacts under `var/artifacts/spec_workflows/<run_id>/`.\\n    45\\t\\n    46\\t### Implementation for User Story 1\\n    47\\t- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Define service metadata (allow-listed files, compose service names, health URLs) in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/service_profiles.py` so instructions can be validated up front.\\n    48\\t- [ ] T010 [US1] Implement ActionPlan generation logic in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/action_plan.py` that expands instructions into analyze/patch/build/restart/verify steps with parameters.\\n    49\\t- [ ] T011 [US1] Build the patch/build/restart command runner in `moonmind/workflows/orchestrator/command_runner.py`, including allow-list enforcement, compose invocations, and artifact writers for diffs/build logs.\\n    50\\t- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement Celery step tasks and chaining in `moonmind/workflows/orchestra\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n   129\\t\\n   130\\t### User Story 3 – Policy-Governed Rollback & Approvals\\n   131\\t```\\n   132\\tTask: T021 [US3] policies.py approval enforcement\\n   133\\tTask: T023 [US3] rollback logic in command_runner.py and tasks.py\\n   134\\tTask: T025 [P] [US3] integration tests covering approval + rollback\\n   135\\t```\\n   136\\t\\n   137\\t---\\n   138\\t\\n   139\\t## Implementation Strategy\\n   140\\t- **MVP (US1)**: Complete Phases 1–3 to queue and execute autonomous fix runs with artifact capture; validate via the US1 integration test before moving on.\\n   141\\t- **Incremental Delivery**: After MVP, layer in US2 visibility endpoints/tests so audit data is available without affecting run execution, then add US3 approval/rollback to protect sensitive services.\\n   142\\t- **Parallelization**: Once Foundational tasks land, separate contributors can tackle US1 planning/command code, US2 API visibility, and US3 policy logic concurrently using the parallel task examples while coordinating on shared files.\\n   143\\t- **Verification**: After each phase, run the quickstart Compose stack (`docker compose up rabbitmq celery-worker api orchestrator`) and targeted tests to confirm the feature slice is independently shippable.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
