# MoonMind

**MoonMind is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app built with LangChain, FastAPI, Open-WebUI, Qdrant, and docker-compose. The API adheres to the OpenAI architecture, so Open-WebUI can be swapped for any OpenAI-compatible UI. In a future release, it will suport easy swapping between different vector databases.**.
